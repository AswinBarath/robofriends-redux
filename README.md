## What's unique in this Project

- Robofriends is a responsive front-end web application built with React JS library 
- The Web App uses Fetch API to get both JSON dummy user data and Random Robo Images.
- It also excels with the Search box for searching user cards based on the dummy user data as the key to filter on a responsive web layout.
- The Web App also displays a cool "**Loading...**" message until the fetch API gets all the data for the user. This way the user gets the context of the application and creates a curiosity to wait and look have a loop at the web app.
- This version of Robofriends takes extra care about the dummy user data while performing the search feature. This way of managing the state makes the web app more performant.
